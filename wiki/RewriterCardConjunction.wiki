#summary R_card_conjunction( | F |_X, quantification )
R_card_conjunction( | F |,,X,,, quantification )
<pre>
inputs: F is False, True, a literal, a multi-equality, or a conjunction.
        "quantification" is either "there exists", "for all", or "none".
return: a basic expression equivalent to | F |_X, if quantification is "none".
        If quantification is "for all", returns a counting-solution, the leaves 
            of which may differ from the exact one in the following way: 
            when the exact one is not ||X||, it may be any value but ||X||.
        If quantification is "there exists", returns a counting-solution, the leaves 
            of which may differ from the exact one in the following way: 
            when the exact one is not 0, it may be any value but 0.
