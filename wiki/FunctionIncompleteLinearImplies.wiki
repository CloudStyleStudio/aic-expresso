incomplete_linear_implies(G, H)
<pre>
Runs in linear time on the size of G and H.
inputs: G and H are formulas.
return: whether G is known to imply H according the methods used by this function 
        (a return value of "false" does not mean that G does not imply H, 
         it merely means that this function does not know that it does).
