#summary replace_conjunct_and_top_simplify(F, i, F1 and ... and Fn)
replace_conjunct_and_top_simplify(F, i, F,,1,, and ... and F,,n,,)
<pre>
This function is intended for simplifying conjunctions obtained from replacing a given conjunct 
by another in a conjunction that has already been checked for obvious simplifications.

inputs: F and each Fi is any formula.
        i is an integer in {1,..., n}
return: a possibly simplified expression equivalent to
        F1 and ... and Fi-1 and F and Fi+1 and ... and Fn, in linear time.
