#summary Getting started using the AIC-Expresso project (for developers).

= Setting up your workspace =
You can check out from the project's Subversion repository directly. For this you will require a Subversion client, see the following for useful instructions:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/aic-expresso/source/checkout]
  * [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html]
  
and check out the trunk to a directory named __aic-expresso__ in your workspace.

==Using the Command Line and <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> ==

__AIC-Expresso__ consists of a single Maven pom.xml file and can be built from the command line using Maven as follows:
<code>
mvn clean test
</code>
== Using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>==
*Note:* The <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> Subversion client is a useful plugin for the Eclipse IDE. Refer to http://subclipse.tigris.org/ for details on how to setup your Eclipse IDE to use the plugin. The following instructions detail how to download the AIC-Expresso project using this plugin.
