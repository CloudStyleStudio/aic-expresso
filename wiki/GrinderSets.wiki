#summary Set Rewriters

This library manipulates _extensional_ and _intensional_ set definitions. 

===Extensional Sets===
Extensional definitions simply explicitly enumerate the elements of a set, for example:

    `{1,2,3}`

===Intensional Sets===
Intensional definitions list a tuple of _indices_ and their domains, a condition on those indices, and a function application on idices (the set's _head_). Indices satisfying the condition are used by the function application to compute a member of thee set. For example:

    `{ (on X in {1,2,3,4}) X + 1 | X != 3}`

===Multisets===
Multiset definitions are denoted by the use of double curly brackets (`{{ }}`) instead of single ones (`{ }`), for both intensional and extensional definitions.
