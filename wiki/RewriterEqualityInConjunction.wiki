R_equality_in_conjunction(| x,,i,, = t and Phi |,,X,,, quantification) - ([http://code.google.com/p/aic-expresso/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/sri/ai/grinder/library/equality/cardinality/direct/core/EqualityInConjunction.java implementation])
<pre>
inputs: Phi is a formula, x_i is one of the index variables in X, t is a variable or a constant.
        "quantification" is either "there exists", "for all", or "none".
return: a basic expression equivalent to | F |_X, if quantification is "none".
        If quantification is "for all", returns a counting-solution, the leaves 
            of which may differ from the exact one in the following way: 
            when the exact one is not ||X||, it may be any value but ||X||.
        If quantification is "there exists", returns a counting-solution, the leaves 
            of which may differ from the exact one in the following way: 
            when the exact one is not 0, it may be any value but 0.
