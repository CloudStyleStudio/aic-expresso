#summary Logic Rewriters

A collection of Rewriters is included that can be applied to first order logic formulas.

===Logical Connectives===
  * `not` :
  * `and` (conjunction) :
  * `or` (disjunction) :
  * `=>` (implies) :
  * `<=>` (equivalence) :

===Quantification===
In addition, support for the standard quantification in first order logic:
  * `there exists . : .` (existential) :
  * `for all . : .` (universal):

*Note:* 

In standard first order logic, quantification can typically be done on variables only. However, we allow [QuantificationOfFunctionApplications function applications to be quantified as well].
