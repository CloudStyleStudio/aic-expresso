#summary Logic Rewriters

A collection of Rewriters is included that can be applied to first order logic formulas.

===Logical Connectives===
  * `not` (negation) e.g.: 
{{{
not true  -> false
not false -> true
not not X -> X
}}}
  * `and` (conjunction) e.g.:
  * `or` (disjunction) e.g.:
  * `=>` (implies) e.g.:
  * `<=>` (equivalence) e.g.:

===Quantification===
In addition, support for the standard quantification in first order logic:
  * `there exists . : .` (existential) :
  * `for all . : .` (universal):

*Note:* Quantification of more than one variable is achieved by nesting the quantifiers, for example:

`for all X : for all Y : X != Y`

In standard first order logic, quantification can typically be done on variables only. We allow [QuantificationOfFunctionApplications function applications to be quantified as well].
