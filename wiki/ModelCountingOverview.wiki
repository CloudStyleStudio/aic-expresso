=== Pseudo-Code for Computing the Cardinallity of a Set ===
Let `L` be a language with no function symbols and a single predicate representing equality, but it may have distinct constant symbols. Let `F` be a quantifier formula in `L`. Let `|F|_{x1, ..., xn}` denote the cardinality of the set `{(x1, ..., xn) | F}{x1, ..., xn}`. We shall define a series of rewriters to compute `|F|_{x1, ..., xn}`.
