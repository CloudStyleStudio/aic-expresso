== Pseudo-Code for Computing the Cardinallity of a Set ==
Let `L` be a language with no function symbols and a single predicate representing equality, but it may have distinct constant symbols. Let `F` be a quantifier formula in `L`. Let
    <wiki:gadget url="http://mathml-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mathml-gadget.xml" border="0" up_content="|F|_{x_1, ..., x_n}" height="25"/> 

denote the cardinality of the set

We shall define a series of rewriters to compute 

    <wiki:gadget url="http://mathml-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mathml-gadget.xml" border="0" up_content="|F|_{x_1, ..., x_n}" height="25"/>

We need the following definition for our process.

Definition:  An expression `E` is Easily Summable `(ES)` with respect to variables x,,1,,,...,x,,n,, iff it has one of the following forms:
  * `E` is some constant `c`.
  * `E` is a variable other than x,,1,,,...,x,,n,,
  * `E` is of the form "if C then t,,1,, else t,,2,," where t,,1,, and t,,2,, are `ES` with respect to x,,1,,,...,x,,n,, and `C` is a quantifier-free formaula in `L`.
  * `E` is of the form f(t,,1,,, ..., t,,n,,) where t,,1,,,...,t,,n,, are `ES` with respect to x,,1,,,...,x,,n,,.

For a set of index variables `X`, `||X||` denotes the project of the cardinalities of domain sizes of index variables in `X`. For instance, if `X = {x, y}`, then
