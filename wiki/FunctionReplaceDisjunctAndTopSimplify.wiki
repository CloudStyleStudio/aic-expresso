#summary replace_disjunct_and_top_simplify(F, i, F1 or ... or Fn)
replace_disjunct_and_top_simplify(F, i, F,,1,, or ... or F,,n,,)
<pre>
This function is intended for simplifying disjunctions obtained from replacing a given disjunct 
by another in a disjunction that has already been checked for obvious simplifications.
inputs: F and each Fi is any formula.
        i is an integer in {1,..., n}
return: a possibly simplified expression equivalent to
        F1 or ... or Fi-1 or F or Fi+1 or ... or Fn, in linear time.
