<pre>
inputs: F is an expression.
return: a simplification of F if possible, otherwise F if already in simplest form.

| // Exhaustively simplifies the given expression until no further simplification is possible.<br>
| // Note: It will not necessarily use full satisfiability testing as part of its simplification logic.<br>
