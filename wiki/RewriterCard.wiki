R_card(| F |_{x,,1,,, ..., x,,n,,})
<pre>
  inputs: F a first-order formula on equalities,
          i.e. F is a boolean combination of equalities and disequalities of variables and constants. 
          F may have quantifiers.
  return: a basic expression representing |F|.
</pre>
F <- R_top_simplify(F) // this is the only function that does not assume its input is top-simplified
