R_sum_over_one_variable(sum___{x: Cx} S)
<pre>
inputs: Cx is a formula in boolean logic, constraining the values of the summation index x.
        S is an Easily-Summable expression with respect to x, that is:
            if S is not an if-then-else expression, then x does not occur in S.
            if S is an expression of the form 'if Q then E1 else E2' 
                where E1 and E2 are Easily-Summable with respect to x.
return: a counting solution.
